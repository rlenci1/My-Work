# Traveltide Analysis
## This was my second mastery project, doing a funnel analysis for a ridesharing company called TravelTide. I started by writing a SQL query to pull specific information, in a way to show users in every step of the process, from downloading the app, creating an account, requesting a ride, completing a ride, completing payment, and finally, reviews.
